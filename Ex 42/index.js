//42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
//Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by 
//adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that 
//the list has actually been modified.
//define the functions to show megicians name
function show_magicians(megicians) {
    megicians.forEach(function (name) { return console.log(name); });
}

}
//defining array
var megicians_name = ["Fabiha", "Fatima", "Wajiha"];
var great_megicians = make_great(megicians_name);
