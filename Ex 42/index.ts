//42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
//Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by 
//adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that 
//the list has actually been modified.


//define the functions to show megicians name
function show_magicians(megicians:string[]){
    megicians.forEach(name => console.log(name))

}
//call make great function to modify megicians name
function make_great(megicians:string[]){

}

//defining array
