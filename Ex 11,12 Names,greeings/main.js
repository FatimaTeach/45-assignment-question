//11. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name 
//by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
//print a message to them.The text of each message should be the same, 
//but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// //storing friends name in array
// let names = ["Faryal", "kusar", "fatima", "farheen"];
// //Printing one by one
// console.log(names[0]); 
// console.log(names[1]);
// console.log(names[2]);
// console.log(names[3]);
//storing friends name in array
var names = ["Faryal", "kusar", "fatima", "farheen"];
